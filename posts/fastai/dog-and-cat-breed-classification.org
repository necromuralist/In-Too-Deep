* Departure
  This is lesson one from the [[https://www.fast.ai][fastai]] course [[https://course.fast.ai/index.html][Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3]], which I assume is the third version of the course, and not a reference to a [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kamen_Rider_V3][Japanese television show]]. It uses the [[http://www.fast.ai/2018/10/02/fastai-ai/][fastai V1 library]] which uses [[https://hackernoon.com/pytorch-1-0-468332ba5163][Pytorch 1.0]] but is an [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Convention_over_configuration][opinionated framework]] that bundles some sensible defaults so you don't have to spend as much time building the networks.

The goal is to train a neural network to identify the breeds of cats and dogs based of photos of them. It uses the [[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/][Oxford-IIT Pet Dataset]] which was created by researchers at Oxford University's [[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/][Visual Geometry Group]].
** Imports
*** Python
    Other than the [[https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/re.html][=re=]] none of the python imports were part of the original lesson. I'm importing [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html][gc]] to do garbage collection because the lesson starts with a smaller network and then changes to a larger one which caused my machine to run out of memory on the GPU. The rest of the imports are for settings and setup.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
from argparse import Namespace
from functools import partial
from pathlib import Path
import gc
import os
import re
#+end_src
*** PyPi
    =fastai= recommends using =*= to import everything, but I'd like to know where everything comes from and not import something that might conflict with my naming conventions so I'm going to (at least try to) import things individually. Luckily, unlike some projects (I'm looking at you, [[https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/][bokeh]]), their site has a search feature so you can look things up.

I'll keep the =fast.ai= stuff separate to maybe make it easier to reference what comes from where.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
from fastai.datasets import untar_data, URLs
from fastai.metrics import accuracy, error_rate

    ImageDataBunch)
from fastai.vision.learner import cnn_learner
from fastai.vision.models import resnet18, resnet34, resnet50
from fastai.vision.transform import get_transforms
#+end_src

And the rest... 
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from ipyexperiments import IPyExperimentsPytorch
from tabulate import tabulate
import holoviews
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot

#+end_src
*** My Stuff
    This is just some convenience stuff wrapped around other people's code (my lite-version of opinionated code).
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
from graeae.tables import CountPercentage
from graeae.timers import Timer
from graeae.visualization import EmbedHoloview
#+end_src
** Some Setup
*** Some Constants
    There's a lot of values scattered all over the place and I just wanted one place to keep track of them and maybe change them if needed.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
Net = Namespace(
    random_seed=2,
    batch_size=64,
    low_memory_batch_size=16,
)
#+end_src
*** The Random Seed
    To make this reproducible I'll set the random seed in numpy.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
numpy.random.seed(Net.random_seed)
#+end_src
*** The Path
    This loads where I put the image data-set.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
load_dotenv(".env", override=True)
DATA_PATH = Path(os.environ.get("OXFORD_PET_DATASET")).expanduser()
#+end_src
*** Plotting
    Although I'd prefer to plot things in HoloViews/bokeh, some of their stuff is too tightly bundled to make it easy (and the image plots maybe don't need to be interactive) so this sets up some formatting for the matplotlib plots.
**** Matplotlib
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
get_ipython().run_line_magic('config', "InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'")
seaborn.set(style="whitegrid",
            rc={"axes.grid": False,
                "font.family": ["sans-serif"],
                "font.sans-serif": ["Open Sans", "Latin Modern Sans", "Lato"],
                "figure.figsize": (8, 6)},
            font_scale=1)
#+END_SRC

**** The Bokeh
     This sets up some stuff for the javascript-based plotting.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
holoviews.extension("bokeh")
SLUG = "dog-and-cat-breed-classification"
OUTPUT_FOLDER = Path("../../files/posts/fastai/")/SLUG
Embed = partial(EmbedHoloview, folder_path=OUTPUT_FOLDER)
#+END_SRC

This is where I'm going to put the settings for the javascript-based plotting.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
Plot = Namespace(
    width = 1000,
    height = 800,
)
#+END_SRC
*** The Timer
    This times how long things take so I can estimate how long it will take if I re-run cells. It also speaks a message so I can do something else and will know that the code is done running without having to watch the messages.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
TIMER = Timer()
#+END_SRC
*** Tabulate
    This is to format tables in the org-mode format (since I'm running this in emacs org-babel).
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
ORG_TABLE = partial(tabulate, headers="keys", 
                    showindex=False, 
                    tablefmt="orgtbl")
#+END_SRC
* Initiation
** Downloading the Data

As I mentioned before, the data will be the [[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/][Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset]] by [[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2012/parkhi12a/parkhi12a.pdf][O. M. Parkhi et al., 2012]]. In the dataset there are twelve breeds of cat and twenty-five breeds of dog. When the researchers performed their experiments in 2012 the best accuracy they got was 59.21 %.

The original lesson uses the [[https://docs.fast.ai/datasets.html#untar_data][untar_data]] function to download the data-set.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
help(untar_data)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Help on function untar_data in module fastai.datasets:
: 
: untar_data(url:str, fname:Union[pathlib.Path, str]=None, dest:Union[pathlib.Path, str]=None, data=True, force_download=False) -> pathlib.Path
:     Download `url` to `fname` if it doesn't exist, and un-tgz to folder `dest`.
: 

This data set is 774 Megabytes and given my over-priced yet still incredibly slow CenturyLink speeds I found downloading it directly from the [[https://course.fast.ai/datasets#image-classification][fastai datasets page]] a little more satisfactory, since the progress widget that runs during the download  when =untar_data= downloads the dataset doesn't show up in emacs.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
assert DATA_PATH.is_dir()
print(DATA_PATH)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet

I didn't know it, but =Paths= have an =ls= method (so far as I could see this isn't in [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html][python's documentation]]) which I mention because I found out because it was in the original lesson. This is nice because, well, it's easy to remember, but the way I'm using it =iterdir= makes more sense.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both
for path in DATA_PATH.iterdir():
    print(f" - {path}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/images_backup
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/README.org
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/images
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/annotations


Here's another trick I didn't know about, but learned from the lesson - instead of using the =joinpath= method you can just use a forward-slash.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
path_to_annotations = DATA_PATH/'annotations'
path_to_images = DATA_PATH/'images'
#+end_src

** Looking At the Data
*** Getting the Labels
   Here's where we peek at our data set. The dataset is set up so that the breeds are used in the names of the image files. =fast.ai= has a convenient classmethod named [[https://docs.fast.ai/vision.data.html#ImageDataBunch.from_name_re][ImageDataBunch.from_name_re]] that will extract the labels from the filenames using a [[https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html][regular expression]].

Before we get to that, though, we can take a look at some file names using [[https://docs.fast.ai/vision.data.html#get_image_files][get_image_files]].

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both
file_names = get_image_files(path_to_images)
for path in file_names[:5]:
    print(f" - {path.name}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
 - Boxer_20.jpg
 - Saint_Bernard_195.jpg
 - Saint_Bernard_133.jpg
 - English_Cocker_Spaniel_43.jpg
 - Pug_51.jpg

So it looks like the format is =<breed>_<index>.jpg=. Later on we're going to use the labels when we inspect the model so next I'm going to make the standardize the file-name cases to be title-cased.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both
UNDERSCORE, SPACE = "_", " "
for path in file_names:
    name, extension = os.path.splitext(path.name)
    name = name.replace(UNDERSCORE, SPACE).title()
    file_name = (name + extension).replace(SPACE, UNDERSCORE)
    target = path.parent.joinpath(file_name)
    path.rename(target)

file_names = get_image_files(path_to_images)
for path in file_names[:2]:
    print(f" - {path.name}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
 - Boxer_20.jpg
 - Saint_Bernard_195.jpg

Now I'll construct the pattern to match the file-name.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
is_not_a = "^"
end_of_line = "$"
one_or_more = "+"
digit = r"\d"
forward_slash = "/"
character_class = "[{}]"
group = "({})"

anything_but_a_slash = character_class.format(f"{is_not_a}{forward_slash}")

index = rf"{digit}{one_or_more}"
label = group.format(f'{anything_but_a_slash}{one_or_more}')
file_extension = ".jpg"

expression = rf'{forward_slash}{label}{UNDERSCORE}{index}{file_extension}{end_of_line}'
test = "/home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/images/Saint_Bernard_195.jpg"
assert re.search(expression, test).groups()[0] == "Saint_Bernard"
#+end_src

The reason for the forward slash at the beginning of the expression is that we're passing in the entire path to each image, not just the name of the image.

Now on to the =ImageDataBunch=. Here's the arguments we need to pass in.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(help(ImageDataBunch.from_name_re))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Help on method from_name_re in module fastai.vision.data:
: 
: from_name_re(path:Union[pathlib.Path, str], fnames:Collection[pathlib.Path], pat:str, valid_pct:float=0.2, **kwargs) method of builtins.type instance
:     Create from list of `fnames` in `path` with re expression `pat`.
: 
: None

Okay, so let's get the labels.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
data = ImageDataBunch.from_name_re(path_to_images, 
                                   file_names, 
                                   expression, 
                                   ds_tfms=get_transforms(), 
                                   size=224, 
                                   bs=Net.batch_size
                                  ).normalize(imagenet_stats)
#+end_src

One of the arguments we passed in (=ds_tfms=?) isn't particularly obviously named, unless you already know about applying transforms to images, but here's what we passed to it.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(help(get_transforms))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Help on function get_transforms in module fastai.vision.transform:

:     Utility func to easily create a list of flip, rotate, `zoom`, warp, lighting transforms.
: 
: None

[[https://docs.fast.ai/vision.transform.html#get_transforms][get_transforms]] adds random changes to the images to augment the datasets for our training.

We also added a call to [[https://docs.fast.ai/vision.data.html#normalize][normalize]] which sets the mean and standard deviation of the images to match those of the images used to train the model that we're going to use ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385][ResNet]]).

*** Looking at Some of the Images
The [[https://docs.fast.ai/basic_data.html#DataBunch.show_batch][show_batch]] method will plot some of the images in matplotlib. It retrieves them randomly so calling the method repeatedly will pull up different images. Unfortunately you can't pass in a figure or axes so it isn't easily configurable.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
help(data.show_batch)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Help on method show_batch in module fastai.basic_data:
:

:     Show a batch of data in `ds_type` on a few `rows`.
: 

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results raw drawer :ipyfile ../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/show_batch.png
data.show_batch(rows=3, figsize=(7,6))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
# Out[25]:
[[file:../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/show_batch.png]]
:end:

[[file:show_batch.png]]

I'm guessing that the reason why so many images look "off" is because the of the data-transforms being added, and not that the photographers were horrible (or drunk). Why don't we look at the representation of the data bunch?

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(data)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
ImageDataBunch;

Train: LabelList (5912 items)
x: ImageList
Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224)
y: CategoryList
Boxer,Saint_Bernard,Saint_Bernard,Ragdoll,Birman
Path: /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/images;

Valid: LabelList (1478 items)
x: ImageList
Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224),Image (3, 224, 224)
y: CategoryList
Siamese,British_Shorthair,English_Cocker_Spaniel,Newfoundland,Russian_Blue
Path: /home/athena/data/datasets/images/oxford-iiit-pet/images;

Test: None
#+end_example

So it looks like the =ImageDataBunch= created a training and a validation set and each of the images has three channels and is 224 x 224 pixels.

** Training: resnet34

 Here's where we train the model, a [[http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/][convolutional neural network]] in the back with a fully-connected network at the end.

I'll use =fast.ai's= [[https://docs.fast.ai/vision.learner.html#cnn_learner][cnn_learner]] to load the data, pre-trained model (=resnet34=), and the metric to use when training ([[https://docs.fast.ai/metrics.html#error_rate][error_rate]]). If you look at the [[https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/vision/models/__init__.py][fast ai code]] they are importing the =resnet34= model from [[https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#id3][pytorch's torchvision]].

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
learn = cnn_learner(data, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example

#+end_example

As you can see, it downloaded the stored model parameters from pytorch. This is because I've never downloaded this particular model before - if you run it again it shouldn't need to re-download it. Since this is a [[https://pytorch.org][pytorch]] model we can look at it's represetantion to see the architecture of the network.

That's a pretty big network, but the main thing to notice is the last layer, which has 37 =out_features= which corresponds to the number of breeds we have in our data-set. If you were working directly with pytorch you'd have to remove the last layer and add it back yourself, but =fast.ai= has done this for us.

Now we need to train it using the [[https://docs.fast.ai/train.html#fit_one_cycle][fit_one_cycle]] method. At first I thought 'one cycle' meant just one pass through the batches but according to the [[https://docs.fast.ai/callbacks.one_cycle.html][documentation]], this is a reference to a training method called the [[https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html][1Cycle Policy]] proposed by [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820][Leslie N. Smith]] that changes the hyperparameters to make the model train faster.

Depending on how busy the computer is this takes two to three minutes when I run it. Next let's store the parameters for the trained model.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
learn.save('stage-1')
#+END_SRC

** Results
   Let's look at how the model did. If I was running this in a jupyter notebook there would be a table output of the accuracy, but I'm not, and I can't find any documentation on how to get that myself, so, tough luck, then. We can look at some things after the fact, though - the [[https://docs.fast.ai/train.html#ClassificationInterpretation][ClassificationInterpretation]] class contains methods to help look at how the model did.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
interpreter = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)
#+END_SRC

The [[https://docs.fast.ai/vision.learner.html#ClassificationInterpretation.top_losses][top_losses]] method returns a tuple of the highest losses along with the indices of the data that gave those losses. By default it actually gives all the losses sorted from largest to smallest, but you could pass in an integer to limit how much it returns.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
losses, indexes = interpreter.top_losses()
print(losses)
print(indexes)
assert len(data.valid_ds)==len(losses)==len(indexes)
#+END_SRC

: tensor([1298, 1418,  131,  ...,  314,  735,  404])

                                           xlabel="Loss", 
                                           width=Plot.width, 
                                           height=Plot.height)

Although it looks like there are negative losses, that's just the way the distribution works out, it looks like most of the losses are around zero.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(losses.max())
print(losses.min())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Here's a count of the losses when they are broken up into ten bins.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both
bins = pandas.cut(losses.tolist(), bins=10).value_counts().reset_index()
total = bins[0].sum()
percentage = 100 * bins[0]/total
bins["percent"] = percentage
print(ORG_TABLE(bins, headers="Range Count Percent(%)".split()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

| (6.522, 7.337]    |     1 |   0.067659 |
| (7.337, 8.153]    |     1 |   0.067659 |

It's not entirely clear to me how to interpret the losses - what does a loss of seven mean, exactly? -0.00744? But, anyway, it looks like the vast majority are less than one.

Another thing we can do is plot the images that had the highest losses.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results raw drawer :ipyfile ../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/top_losses.png
interpreter.plot_top_losses(9, figsize=(15,11))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:results:
# Out[36]:
[[file:../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/top_losses.png]]
:end:

[[file:top_losses.png]]

It looks like the ones that had the most loss had some kind of weird flare effect applied to the image. Now that we've used it, maybe we can see how we're supposed to call =plot_top_losses=.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(help(interpreter.plot_top_losses))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*Note:* in the original notebook they were using a function called [[https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/gen_doc/nbdoc.py#L126][doc]], which tries to open another window and will thus hang when run in emacs. They /really/ want you to use jupyter.

Next let's look at the [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Confusion_matrix][confusion matrix]].

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results raw drawer :ipyfile ../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/confusion_matrix.png
interpreter.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(12,12), dpi=60)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:results:
# Out[38]:
[[file:../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/confusion_matrix.png]]
:end:

[[file:confusion_matrix.png]]

One way to interpret this is to look at the x-axis (the actual breed) and sweep vertically up to see the counts for the y-axis (what our model predicted it was). The diagonal cells from the top left to the bottom right is where the predicted matched the actual. In this case, the fact that almost all the counts are in the diagonal means our model did pretty well at predicting the breeds in the images.

If you compare the images with the worst losses to the confusion matrix you'll notice that they don't seem to correlate with the worst performances overall - the worst losses were one-offs, probably due to the flare effect. The most confused was the /Ragdoll/ being confused for a /Birman/, but, as noted in the lecture, [[https://pets.thenest.com/birman-vs-ragdoll-cat-11758.html][distinguishing them is hard for people too]]. 

Here's the breeds that were the hardest for the model to predict.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both

It doesn't look too bad, actually, other that the first few entries, maybe.
** Unfreezing, fine-tuning, and learning rates

So, this is what we get with a straight off-the-shelf setup from =fast.ai=, but we want more, don't we? Let's [[https://docs.fast.ai/basic_train.html#Learner.unfreeze][*unfreeze*]] the model and train some more.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
learn.unfreeze()
#+END_SRC

Since we are using a pre-trained model we normally freeze all but the last layer to do transfer learning, by unfreezing the mode we'll train all the layers to our dataset.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
TIMER.message = "Finished training the unfrozen model."
with TIMER:
    learn.fit_one_cycle(1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: Ended: 2019-04-21 10:17:46.477064
: Elapsed: 0:00:40.143876

Now we save it again.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session fastai :results none
learn.save('stage-1');
#+END_SRC

Now we're going to use the [[https://docs.fast.ai/callbacks.lr_finder.html][lr_find]] method to find the best learning rate.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
TIMER.message = "Finished finding the best learning rate."

#+END_SRC

:end:

[[file:learning.png]]


So, it's kind of hard to see the exact number, but you can see that somewhere around a learning rate of 0.0001 we get a good loss and then after that the loss starts to go way up.

So next we're going to re-train it using an interval that hopefully gives us the best loss.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
learn.unfreeze()
with TIMER:
    print(learn.fit_one_cycle(2, max_lr=slice(1e-6,1e-4)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: Elapsed: 0:01:19.803948

** Training: resnet50

Okay, so we trained the =resnet34= model, and although I haven't figured out how to tell exactly how well it's doing, it seems to be doing pretty well. Now it's time to try the =resnet50= model, which has pretty much the same architecture but more layers. This means it should do better, but it also takes up a lot more memory, so step one is to delete the old model.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
del learn
gc.collect()
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
#+end_src


Even after deleting the old model I still run out of memory so I'm going to have to fall back to a smaller batch-size. I'm going to try running it in an [[https://github.com/stas00/ipyexperiments/blob/master/docs/ipyexperiments.md][IPyExperiments]] block to help with cleaning up the memory.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
resnet_experiment = IPyExperimentsPytorch()
#+end_src

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
data = ImageDataBunch.from_name_re(
    path_to_images, 
    file_names, 
    expression, 
    ds_tfms=get_transforms(),
    size=299, 
    bs=Net.low_memory_batch_size).normalize(imagenet_stats)
#+end_src

Now I'll re-build the learner with the new pre-trained model.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
learn = cnn_learner(data, resnet50, metrics=error_rate)
#+end_src

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results raw drawer :ipyfile ../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/learning_50.png
learn.lr_find()
learn.recorder.plot()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
# Out[49]:
[[file:../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/learning_50.png]]
:end:

[[file:learning_50.png]]

So with this learner we can see that there's a rapd drop in loss followed by a sudden spike in loss.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
TIMER.message = "Done fitting resnet 50"
with TIMER:
    learn.fit_one_cycle(8)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

: Ended: 2019-04-21 10:35:40.336790
: Elapsed: 0:15:24.342387

Now we can save it.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
learn.save('stage-1-50')
#+end_src

Now we can try and unfreeze and re-train it.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
TIMER.message = "Finished training resnet 50 with the optimal learning rate."
learn.unfreeze()
with TIMER:
    learn.fit_one_cycle(3, max_lr=slice(1e-6,1e-4))
#+end_src

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both

    metrics = learn.validate()
#+end_src

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(f"Error Rate: {metrics[0]:.2f}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Error Rate: 0.16

Since it didn't improve let's go back to the previous model.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
learn.load('stage-1-50');
with TIMER:
    metrics = learn.validate()
print(f"Error Rate: {metrics[0]:.2f}")

It got fewer breeds with more than two wrong than the =resnet34= model did, but both of them seem to have trouble telling an American Pit Bull Terrier from a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

** Other Data Formats
   This is a look at other data sets.
*** MNIST
    This is a set of handwritten digits. The originals are hosted on [[http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/][yann.lecun.com]] but the [[https://course.fast.ai/datasets#image-classification][fast.ai datasets page]] has the images converted from the original IDX format to the PNG format.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
mnist_path_original = Path(os.environ.get("MNIST")).expanduser()
assert mnist_path_original.is_dir()
print(mnist_path_original)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /home/athena/data/datasets/images/mnist_png

Now that we know it's there we can create a data bunch for it... Actually I tried it and found out that this is the wrong set (it throws an error for some reason), let's try it their way.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
print(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)
mnist_path = untar_data(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)
print(mnist_path)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: http://files.fast.ai/data/examples/mnist_sample
: Downloading http://files.fast.ai/data/examples/mnist_sample
: /home/athena/.fastai/data/mnist_sample

Let's look at the difference. Here's what I downloaded.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both
for path in mnist_path_original.iterdir():
    print(f" - {path}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/mnist_png/testing
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/mnist_png/README.org
 - /home/athena/data/datasets/images/mnist_png/training

And here's what they downloaded.
#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output raw :exports both
for path in mnist_path.iterdir():
    print(f" - {path}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
 - /home/athena/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/labels.csv
 - /home/athena/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train
 - /home/athena/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid

Maybe you need a =labels.csv= file... I guess that's the point of this being in the "other formats" section.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results none
transforms = get_transforms(do_flip=False)
data = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(mnist_path, ds_tfms=transforms, size=26)
#+end_src

I don't know why the size is 26 in this case.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results raw drawer :ipyfile ../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/mnist_batch.png
data.show_batch(rows=3, figsize=(5,5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
# Out[94]:
[[file:../../files/posts/fastai/dog-and-cat-breed-classification/mnist_batch.png]]
:end:

[[file:mnist_batch.png]]

Now to fit the model. This uses a smaller version of the resnet (18 layers) and the =accuracy= metric. This isn't as important here, I don't think, but I'm also going to try using [[https://github.com/stas00/ipyexperiments/blob/master/docs/ipyexperiments.md][ipyexperiments]] to clean up after I'm done.

#+begin_src ipython :session fastai :results output :exports both
