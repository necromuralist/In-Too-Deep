* The Problem
  We are dealing with categories - Duck, Beaver, and Walrus - but our classifier works with numbers, what do we do?
* One Solution
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot][one-hot encoding]], in this context, means taking each of our classifications and creating a column for it and putting a 1 in the row if it matches the column and a 0 otherwise.

| Sighting | Duck | Beaver | Walrus |
|----------+------+--------+--------|
|        0 |    1 |      0 |      0 |
|        1 |    0 |      1 |      0 |
|        2 |    1 |      0 |      0 |
|        3 |    0 |      0 |      1 |
|        4 |    0 |      1 |      0 |
