* Introduction
  This is an exercise in using transfer learning to diagnose melanoma based on images of skin legions. There are three diseases to be detected:
  - Melanoma
  - Nevus
  - Sebhorrheic Keratosis

There is a paper online [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05006.pdf][here]] (PDF link) that describes the approaches that did best in the competition.
* Data
  The data is taken from the [[https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a][ISIC 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection]] challenge.
