* What is this about?
In this project, you'll generate your own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld][Seinfeld]] TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [[https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv][Seinfeld dataset]] of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

The scripts aren't really in a format that is optimized for pandas, at least not for this initial look, so we'll just load it as text.

* Explore the Data
  Note that the first line is a header, but we're ignoring that and including it with the counts. So this is /very/ rough.

|--------------------------------------+---------|
| Number of unique tokens              | 550,996 |

So it looks like the stop words are the most common, as you might expect.

People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.",1.0,S01E01,1.0

As you can see it is a comma-separated file with a header. What's not so obvious is how the index works. Is it for all the lines? Since the episode number is in the row-data I would assume so.

* Pre-Processing the Text
The first thing to do to any dataset is pre-processing.  Implement the following pre-processing functions below:
 - Lookup Table
 - Tokenize Punctuation

** Lookup Table
   To create a word embedding, you first need to transform the words to ids.  In this function, create two dictionaries:
    - Dictionary to go from the words to an id, we'll call =vocab_to_int=
    - Dictionary to go from the id to word, we'll call =int_to_vocab=

Return these dictionaries in the following **tuple** =(vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)=

# In[ ]:


import problem_unittests as tests

def create_lookup_tables(text):
    """
    Create lookup tables for vocabulary
    :param text: The text of tv scripts split into words
    :return: A tuple of dicts (vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)

    # return tuple
    return (None, None)


"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL THAT IS BELOW THIS LINE
"""
tests.test_create_lookup_tables(create_lookup_tables)


# ### Tokenize Punctuation
# We'll be splitting the script into a word array using spaces as delimiters.  However, punctuations like periods and exclamation marks can create multiple ids for the same word. For example, "bye" and "bye!" would generate two different word ids.
# 
# Implement the function `token_lookup` to return a dict that will be used to tokenize symbols like "!" into "||Exclamation_Mark||".  Create a dictionary for the following symbols where the symbol is the key and value is the token:
# - Period ( **.** )
# - Comma ( **,** )
# - Quotation Mark ( **"** )
# - Semicolon ( **;** )
# - Exclamation mark ( **!** )
# - Question mark ( **?** )
# - Left Parentheses ( **(** )
# - Right Parentheses ( **)** )
# - Dash ( **-** )
# - Return ( **\n** )
# 
# This dictionary will be used to tokenize the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it.  This separates each symbols as its own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict the next word. Make sure you don't use a value that could be confused as a word; for example, instead of using the value "dash", try using something like "||dash||".

# ## Input
# Let's start with the preprocessed input data. We'll use [TensorDataset](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.TensorDataset) to provide a known format to our dataset; in combination with [DataLoader](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), it will handle batching, shuffling, and other dataset iteration functions.
# 
# You can create data with TensorDataset by passing in feature and target tensors. Then create a DataLoader as usual.
# ```
# data = TensorDataset(feature_tensors, target_tensors)
# data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, 
#                                           batch_size=batch_size)
# ```
# 
# ### Batching
# Implement the `batch_data` function to batch `words` data into chunks of size `batch_size` using the `TensorDataset` and `DataLoader` classes.
# 
# >You can batch words using the DataLoader, but it will be up to you to create `feature_tensors` and `target_tensors` of the correct size and content for a given `sequence_length`.
# 
# For example, say we have these as input:
# ```
# words = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
# sequence_length = 4
# ```
# 
# Your first `feature_tensor` should contain the values:
# ```
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
# ```
# And the corresponding `target_tensor` should just be the next "word"/tokenized word value:
# ```
# 5
# ```
# This should continue with the second `feature_tensor`, `target_tensor` being:
# ```
# [2, 3, 4, 5]  # features
# 6             # target
# ```

#

# 
# ```
# torch.Size([10, 5])
# tensor([[ 28,  29,  30,  31,  32],

# 
# ### Sizes
# Your sample_x should be of size `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or (10, 5) in this case and sample_y should just have one dimension: batch_size (10). 
# 
# ### Values
# 
# You should also notice that the targets, sample_y, are the *next* value in the ordered test_text data. So, for an input sequence `[ 28,  29,  30,  31,  32]` that ends with the value `32`, the corresponding output should be `33`.

# ## Build the Neural Network
# Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:
#  - `__init__` - The initialize function. 
#  - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state
#  - `forward` - Forward propagation function.
#  
# The initialize function should create the layers of the neural network and save them to the class. The forward propagation function will use these layers to run forward propagation and generate an output and a hidden state.
# 
# **The output of this model should be the *last* batch of word scores** after a complete sequence has been processed. That is, for each input sequence of words, we only want to output the word scores for a single, most likely, next word.
# 
# ### Hints
# 
# 1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`
# 2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:
# 
# ```
# # reshape into (batch_size, seq_length, output_size)
# output = output.view(batch_size, -1, self.output_size)
# # get last batch
# out = output[:, -1]
# ```

# ### Hyperparameters
# 
# Set and train the neural network with the following parameters:
# - Set `sequence_length` to the length of a sequence.
# - Set `batch_size` to the batch size.
# - Set `num_epochs` to the number of epochs to train for.
# - Set `learning_rate` to the learning rate for an Adam optimizer.
# - Set `vocab_size` to the number of unique tokens in our vocabulary.
# - Set `output_size` to the desired size of the output.
# - Set `embedding_dim` to the embedding dimension; smaller than the vocab_size.
# - Set `hidden_dim` to the hidden dimension of your RNN.
# - Set `n_layers` to the number of layers/cells in your RNN.
# - Set `show_every_n_batches` to the number of batches at which the neural network should print progress.
# 
# If the network isn't getting the desired results, tweak these parameters and/or the layers in the `RNN` class.

# ### Train
# In the next cell, you'll train the neural network on the pre-processed data.  If you have a hard time getting a good loss, you may consider changing your hyperparameters. In general, you may get better results with larger hidden and n_layer dimensions, but larger models take a longer time to train. 
# > **You should aim for a loss less than 3.5.** 
# 
# You should also experiment with different sequence lengths, which determine the size of the long range dependencies that a model can learn.

# With the network trained and saved, you'll use it to generate a new, "fake" Seinfeld TV script in this section.
# 
# ### Generate Text
# To generate the text, the network needs to start with a single word and repeat its predictions until it reaches a set length. You'll be using the `generate` function to do this. It takes a word id to start with, `prime_id`, and generates a set length of text, `predict_len`. Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!

# # The TV Script is Not Perfect
# It's ok if the TV script doesn't make perfect sense. It should look like alternating lines of dialogue, here is one such example of a few generated lines.
#

# 
# >jerry: what about me?
# >
# >jerry: i don't have to wait.
# >
# >kramer:(to the sales table)
# >
# >elaine:(to jerry) hey, look at this, i'm a good doctor.
# >
# >newman:(to elaine) you think i have no idea of this...
# >
# >elaine: oh, you better take the phone, and he was a little nervous.
# >
# >kramer:(to the phone) hey, hey, jerry, i don't want to be a little bit.(to kramer and jerry) you can't.
# >
# >jerry: oh, yeah. i don't even know, i know.
# >
# >jerry:(to the phone) oh, i know.
# >
# >kramer:(laughing) you know...(to jerry) you don't know.
# 
# You can see that there are multiple characters that say (somewhat) complete sentences, but it doesn't have to be perfect! It takes quite a while to get good results, and often, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary (and discard uncommon words), or get more data.  The Seinfeld dataset is about 3.4 MB, which is big enough for our purposes; for script generation you'll want more than 1 MB of text, generally.
