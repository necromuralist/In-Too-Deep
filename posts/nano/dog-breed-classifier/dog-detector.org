* Introduction
  As part of the Dog-Breed Classification application I want to be able to detect whether an image has a dog or a human. This post will use pre-trained models to detect dogs in images.
* Set Up
** Imports
*** From PyPi
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session dog :results none
import torchvision.models as models
#+END_SRC
* VGG-16
My first model will be a pre-trained VGG-16 model that has weights that wer trained on the [[http://www.image-net.org/][ImageNet]] data set.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs which link to an image containing an object from one of [[https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a][1000 categories]].

** Build the Model

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session dog :results output :exports both
VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
VGG16.eval()
VGG16.to(device)
#+END_SRC
