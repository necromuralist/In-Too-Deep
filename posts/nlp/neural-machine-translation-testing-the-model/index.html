# # Part 4:  Testing
# 
# We will now be using the model you just trained to translate English sentences to German. We will implement this with two functions: The first allows you to identify the next symbol (i.e. output token). The second one takes care of combining the entire translated string.
# 
# We will start by first loading in a pre-trained copy of the model you just coded. Please run the cell below to do just that.

# In[ ]:


# instantiate the model we built in eval mode
model = NMTAttn(mode='eval')

# initialize weights from a pre-trained model
model.init_from_file("model.pkl.gz", weights_only=True)
model = tl.Accelerate(model)


# &lt;a name="4.1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
# ## 4.1  Decoding
# 
# As discussed in the lectures, there are several ways to get the next token when translating a sentence. For instance, we can just get the most probable token at each step (i.e. greedy decoding) or get a sample from a distribution. We can generalize the implementation of these two approaches by using the `tl.logsoftmax_sample()` method. Let's briefly look at its implementation:
# 
# ```python
# def logsoftmax_sample(log_probs, temperature=1.0):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
#   """Returns a sample from a log-softmax output, with temperature.
# 
#   Args:
#     log_probs: Logarithms of probabilities (often coming from LogSofmax)
#     temperature: For scaling before sampling (1.0 = default, 0.0 = pick argmax)
#   """
#   # This is equivalent to sampling from a softmax with temperature.
#   u = np.random.uniform(low=1e-6, high=1.0 - 1e-6, size=log_probs.shape)
#   g = -np.log(-np.log(u))
#   return np.argmax(log_probs + g * temperature, axis=-1)
# ```
# 
# The key things to take away here are: 1. it gets random samples with the same shape as your input (i.e. `log_probs`), and 2. the amount of "noise" added to the input by these random samples is scaled by a `temperature` setting. You'll notice that setting it to `0` will just make the return statement equal to getting the argmax of `log_probs`. This will come in handy later. 
# 
# &lt;a name="ex06"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
# ### Exercise 06
# 
# **Instructions:** Implement the `next_symbol()` function that takes in the `input_tokens` and the `cur_output_tokens`, then return the index of the next word. You can click below for hints in completing this exercise.
# 
# &lt;details&gt;    
# &lt;summary&gt;
#     &lt;font size="3" color="darkgreen"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click Here for Hints&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
# &lt;/summary&gt;
# &lt;p&gt;
# &lt;ul&gt;
#     &lt;li&gt;To get the next power of two, you can compute &lt;i&gt;2^log_2(token_length + 1)&lt;/i&gt; . We add 1 to avoid &lt;i&gt;log(0).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
#     &lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;i&gt;np.ceil()&lt;/i&gt; to get the ceiling of a float.&lt;/li&gt;
#     &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;np.log2()&lt;/i&gt; will get the logarithm base 2 of a value&lt;/li&gt;
#     &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;int()&lt;/i&gt; will cast a value into an integer type&lt;/li&gt;
#     &lt;li&gt;From the model diagram in part 2, you know that it takes two inputs. You can feed these with this syntax to get the model outputs: &lt;i&gt;model((input1, input2))&lt;/i&gt;. It's up to you to determine which variables below to substitute for input1 and input2. Remember also from the diagram that the output has two elements: [log probabilities, target tokens]. You won't need the target tokens so we assigned it to _ below for you. &lt;/li&gt;
#     &lt;li&gt; The log probabilities output will have the shape: (batch size, decoder length, vocab size). It will contain log probabilities for each token in the &lt;i&gt;cur_output_tokens&lt;/i&gt; plus 1 for the start symbol introduced by the ShiftRight in the preattention decoder. For example, if cur_output_tokens is [1, 2, 5], the model will output an array of log probabilities each for tokens 0 (start symbol), 1, 2, and 5. To generate the next symbol, you just want to get the log probabilities associated with the last token (i.e. token 5 at index 3). You can slice the model output at [0, 3, :] to get this. It will be up to you to generalize this for any length of cur_output_tokens &lt;/li&gt;
# &lt;/ul&gt;

# ## 4.2  Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding

# As mentioned in the lectures, getting the most probable token at each step may not necessarily produce the best results. Another approach is to do Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding or MBR. The general steps to implement this are:

# 1. take several random samples

# 3. select the one with the highest score
# 
# You will be building helper functions for these steps in the following sections.

# ### 4.2.1 Generating samples

# ### 4.2.2 Comparing overlaps
# 
# Let us now build our functions to compare a sample against another. There are several metrics available as shown in the lectures and you can try experimenting with any one of these. For this assignment, we will be calculating scores for unigram overlaps. One of the more simple metrics is the [Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) which gets the intersection over union of two sets. We've already implemented it below for your perusal.

# let's try using the function. remember the result here and compare with the next function below.

# One of the more commonly used metrics in machine translation is the ROUGE score. For unigrams, this is called ROUGE-1 and as shown in class, you can output the scores for both precision and recall when comparing two samples. To get the final score, you will want to compute the F1-score as given by:
#

# ### 4.2.3 Overall score
# 
# We will now build a function to generate the overall score for a particular sample. As mentioned earlier, we need to compare each sample with all other samples. For instance, if we generated 30 sentences, we will need to compare sentence 1 to sentences 2 to 30. Then, we compare sentence 2 to sentences 1 and 3 to 30, and so forth. At each step, we get the average score of all comparisons to get the overall score for a particular sample. To illustrate, these will be the steps to generate the scores of a 4-sample list.
# 
# 1. Get similarity score between sample 1 and sample 2
# 2. Get similarity score between sample 1 and sample 3
# 3. Get similarity score between sample 1 and sample 4
# 4. Get average score of the first 3 steps. This will be the overall score of sample 1.
# 5. Iterate and repeat until samples 1 to 4 have overall scores.
# 
# We will be storing the results in a dictionary for easy lookups.

# 
# We will now put everything together and develop the `mbr_decode()` function. Please use the helper functions you just developed to complete this. You will want to generate samples, get the score for each sample, get the highest score among all samples, then detokenize this sample to get the translated sentence.
# 
# &lt;a name="ex10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
# ### Exercise 10
# 
# **Instructions**: Implement the `mbr_overlap()` function.
